# POKÉLEMOND REPOSITORY

Hello and welcome to **pokélemond** repository!

You'll notice where is the codebase in this repository? Well, I split codebase repo and issue report/assets repo for some reason. Anyway, if you want to report issue related to pokélemond web app just go to => https://github.com/lemondseven/pokelemond/issues/new 

pokélemond made from:
 - NextJS
 - MUI Icon
 - Framer Motion

Special thanks to Paul Hallett to give us access to **PokéAPI**. Without him and his team, this web app won't be here.
